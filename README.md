# ReportsDialog Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It features a responsive `ReportsDialog` component designed using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project Structure

- `/pages` - Contains the main entry file `index.tsx` where the `ReportsDialog` component is rendered.
- `/components` - Holds the `ReportsDialog` and `Paginator` components which manage the display and pagination of reports respectively.
- `/types` - Contains TypeScript type definitions specific to the project.
- `/data` - Includes mock data used by the `ReportsDialog` component.
